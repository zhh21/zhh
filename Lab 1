Lab 1:
1. Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.
2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.
Fundamental Reasons for Cloud Success:

Scalability and elasticity.

Cost efficiency (pay-as-you-go model).

Global accessibility and collaboration.

Pros of Cloud:

Reduced infrastructure costs.

Rapid deployment and scalability.

Disaster recovery and redundancy.

Cons of Cloud:

Security and privacy risks.

Dependency on internet connectivity.

Potential vendor lock-in.
3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?
The hypervisor (virtual machine monitor) abstracts and partitions physical hardware resources to run multiple isolated virtual machines (VMs).
4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
A VM is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, running an OS and applications as if on dedicated hardware.
5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
Hardware consolidation (multiple VMs on one server).

Isolation (security/testing).

Snapshot/cloning for backups/replication.

Portability across hosts.

Legacy OS/application support.
6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
Server consolidation in data centers.

Development/testing environments.

Sandboxing for security.

Disaster recovery solutions.

Running legacy software.
7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?
a) The main operating system running on the physical machine
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine
c) The operating system running on a remote server
d) The operating system running on a mobile device
Answer: b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine.
8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?
a) Virtual machines can communicate directly with the physical hardware.
b) Virtual machines share the same resources and cannot be isolated.
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.
d) Virtual machines can only be accessed locally.
Answer: c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.

9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?
a) It allows virtual machines to communicate with each other easily.
b) It ensures faster boot times for virtual machines.
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.
d) It reduces the need for hardware virtualization.
Answer: c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.
10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
To create an identical copy of a VM for scaling, backup, or testing without reconfiguration.
